# Sneke
A basic multiplayer snake game using the pygame library. Was created in year 12 as I was learning the fundamentals of Python programming.

Users may choose to play in two-player mode or single-player mode.
Users may further choose to play in sudden death or timed game settings.

Sudden death in the two-player context implies if either of the two snakes collides with one another, the snake whose head collides with the other snake's body will lose the game.
Sudden death in the single-player context implies the traditional snake game.

Timed mode in the two-player context implies within a set time limit the snake that accumulates the most points by eating the most apples, wins.
When a snake collides in the similar fashion mentioned above, it respawns in the board. 

Timed mode in the single-player context involves the same features of respawning, and the game ending after the set time limit.

In timed mode scores for both players are displayed at the end.
